 - Phone contacts from [Wammu](https://wammu.eu) backup (old mobile phones) to CSV, which can be imported on Android smartphones.

 - SMS from [Wammu](https://wammu.eu) backup (old mobile phones) to text file, which can be imported on Android smartphones via [SMS to Text](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smeiti.smstotext).

 - Firefox browsers sessions from [Tab Mix Plus](https://tabmixplus.org) (RDF) to [Tab Session Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tab-session-manager) (JSON). The script was necessary because TMP is no longer supported since the Quantum update.
